# MacOS LinkedIn Shortcut

This repo is a basic config for MacOS using [hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org) to finally add the LinkedIn shortcut key that no one asked for from Windows. With this configuration, you can quickly get to LinkedIn whenever you want by simply pressing `shift+ctrl+opt+cmd+l`.

## Installing

Follow the installation instructions for hammerspoon and place the `.hammerspoon` directory in your home directory. After reloading the config, you will be able to launch LinkedIn using the convenient shortcut key.
